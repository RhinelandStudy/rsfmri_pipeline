  =========

  SETUP

  =========

The FIX package requires FSL, R and one of MATLAB Runtime Component, full MATLAB or Octave. We recommend the use of the MATLAB Runtime Component.

Requires: FSL

Requires: R

Linux:
======

Install R
---------

On Centos:

sudo yum install "@Development Tools" R R-devel

Start R and run the following command
install.packages("devtools")

On Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install r-base r-cran-devtools

Then on either Linux:

require(devtools)
chooseCRANmirror()
install_version("kernlab", version="0.9-24")
install_version("ROCR", version="1.0-7")
install_version("class", version="7.3-14")
install_version("mvtnorm", version="1.0.8")
install_version("multcomp", version="1.4-8")
install_version("coin", version="1.2.2")
install_version("party", version="1.0-25")
install_version("e1071", version="1.6-7")
install_version("randomForest", version="4.6-12")

Inside settings.sh set FSL_FIX_R_CMD to the result of:

which R

(which is usually /usr/bin/R)

macOS:
======

Install R
---------

. $FSLDIR/fslpython/bin/activate $FSLDIR/fslpython/envs/fslpython

If your FSLDIR folder requires admin rights to modify (e.g. it's in /usr/local) then
prepend these commands with sudo.

$FSLDIR/fslpython/bin/conda install R=3.4
$FSLDIR/fslpython/bin/conda install r-rocr=1.0_7 r-kernlab=0.9_25 r-randomForest=4.6_12 r-class=7.3_14 r-e1071=1.6_8 r-devtools

Launch R with:

$FSLDIR/fslpython/envs/fslpython/bin/R

and run the following (with sudo if FSLDIR modifications needs admin rights):

require(devtools)
chooseCRANmirror()
install_version("mvtnorm", version="1.0-8")
install_version("multcomp", version="1.4-8")
install_version("coin", version="1.2-2")
install_version("party", version="1.0-25")

Inside settings.sh set FSL_FIX_R_CMD to $FSLDIR/fslpython/envs/fslpython/bin/R


Requires: MATLAB Style environment

  There are three options for running the MATLAB components of FIX, via the compiled code
  (requires a MATLAB Compiler Runtime) (preferred). In a full MATLAB install (requires
  a purchase AND the Signal Toolbox) or via the open source MATLAB equivalent Octave.

  MATLAB Runtime Component:
  This is the preferred mechanism.

	If there is a folder 'compiled' in the FIX folder then the MATLAB portions have
	been compiled for running without MATLAB. To use this you need to install the
  MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) version that FIX was compiled against. To identify this
  run the script:

  ./mcr_script.sh

  This will give the URL to download the MCR from and indicate which version you need.
  Once you have downloaded the MCR you need to install it somewhere and then set
  FSL_FIX_MCRROOT in 'settings.sh' to refer to the folder containing the runtime(s), e.g.
  if you have a folder /usr/local/mcr which contains the runtime v93, then FSL_FIX_MCRROOT
  should be set to /usr/local/mcr.

or:

  MATLAB, with the following toolboxes:
		signal

or:
  Octave (>=3.4), with the following toolboxes:
        io
        (miscellaneous 1.0.11 for 3.4)
        statistics (1.1.3 for 3.4)
        specfun
        general
        control (2.2.5 for 3.4)
        (struct for 3.4)
        (optim for 3.4)
        signal

  To install these toolboxes, use the script setup_octave.sh - this will ask for a 'sudo' password if
  required (use -g option to install globally rather than for just this user account).

  Octave 3.4
  ==========
  EPEL on Centos/RedHat/Scientific Linux provides Octave 3.4 which cannot install several
  packages from Octave forge, so download the following from http://sourceforge.net/projects/octave/files/Octave%20Forge%20Packages/Individual%20Package%20Releases/
  	miscellaneous-1.0.11.tar.gz
  	statistics-1.1.3.tar.gz
  	control-2.2.5.tar.gz
  	signal-1.1.2.tar.gz
  Change to the folder where these have been downloaded to and install with:
  	octave --eval 'pkg install -auto -forge io; pkg install -auto miscellaneous-1.0.11.tar.gz; \
pkg install -auto statistics-1.1.3.tar.gz; pkg install -auto -forge specfun; pkg install -auto -forge general; \
pkg install -auto control-2.2.5.tar.gz; pkg install -auto -forge struct; pkg instal -auto -forge optim; \
pkg install -auto signal-1.1.2.tar.gz;'
  To install system-wide run Octave as an admin user and add the option '-global' to each 'pkg install' command.

  Octave 3.6
  ==========
  Install the required packages using:
    octave --eval 'pkg install -auto -forge io; pkg install -auto -forge statistics; \
pkg install -auto -forge specfun; pkg install -auto -forge general; \
pkg install -auto -forge control; pkg install -auto -forge signal;'
  To install system-wide run Octave as an admin user and add the option '-global' to each 'pkg install' command.

  =============

  Configuration

  =============

Setup: edit the "settings.sh" script to reflect your system setup - descriptions
of the options are given in this file.
If using the compiled MATLAB version, make sure that FSL_FIX_MCRROOT is set to the location of the MATLAB
Compiler Runtime you installed as per the instructions above.
Setup for using inside HCP pipelines (only needed for HCP):
Ensure the FSL_FIX_CIFTIRW and FSL_FIX_WBC variables in settings.sh are pointed
at your HCP Workbench MATLAB CIFTIRW and Workbench folders respectively.


  ==================

  MATLAB Compilation

  ==================

  The MATLAB .m files can be compiled to allow fix to run without requiring MATLAB
  licenses (especially useful where it will be run on a cluster). Fix is distributed
  with pre-compiled MATLAB components, but if you wish to compile against a different
  MATLAB version (and you have a full commercial license for MATLAB) then you can use
  the following instructions to compile a custom version.

  To compile, ensure you have the MATLAB compiler toolbox installed and GNU make
  (Centos/RedHat/Scientific Linux: sudo yum -y install make
   Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install make
   OS X: Install XCode and the command line tools (XCode Preferences > Downloads) )
  then issue the following command from within the fix folder:
     ./build_MATLAB

  If the script cannot automatically find your 'matlab' command, configure settings.sh
  to point at the matlab and mcc programs.

  This will install the binaries into 'compiled/`OS`/`arch`' (eg
  compiled/Darwin/x86_64 or compiled/Linux/x86_64) and create a file 'MCR.version'
  containing the version number of the MATLAB Compiler Runtime necessary to run
  this program.

  If you wish to build a re-distributable tar.gz file of the compiled software you
  should run ./build_MATLAB on each platform of interest (e.g. Linux and macOS),
  collating the compiled/Linux and compiled/Darwin folders into a single copy of the
  fix folder and then run:
    ./build_MATLAB release

  This will generate fix.tar.gz in the fix folder which can then be distributed.
